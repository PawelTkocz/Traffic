# Traffic
The goal of this project is to make a graphic simulation of urban traffic using Pygame. As the first step, I created the class of the most common vehicle moving on the roads - a car.
I tried to make the motion of my cars look realistic. Currently, there are two programs that You can start:

### 1. ParkingDemo
The program shows a short animation of parallel parking. It's not interactive - just sit and enjoy

## 2. ParkingGame
The program gives You a chance to try to park a car by Yourself. To control the car, You can use the keys:  
Up arrow - speed up  
Left arrow - turn left  
Right arrow - turn right  
Space - brake  
Down arrow - speed up backwards  
(Important! You can not speed up backwards if You are moving forward - You have to brake, stop and only then You can go backwards. It works the same
if You want to speed up while moving backwards)
